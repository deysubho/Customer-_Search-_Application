# Customer-_Search-_Application
This project is a configuration-driven Customer Search Application built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, powered by a JSON Server mock API. The key idea is scalability and flexibility — adding or modifying customer fields should only require changes to configuration files, not component logic.
